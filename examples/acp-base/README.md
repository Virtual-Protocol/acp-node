## Overview

This directory contains a suite of examples to help you understand and implement the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) in Node.js. Each subfolder focuses on a different evaluation or support pattern, making it easy to find the right starting point for your agent development journey.

---

## 🧪 Self-Evaluation
**Folder:** [`self_evaluation/`](./self_evaluation/)

- **Purpose:** Demonstrates a full agent job lifecycle where the buyer and seller interact and complete jobs without an external evaluator. The buyer agent is responsible for evaluating the deliverable.
- **Includes:**
  - Example scripts for both buyer and seller agents
  - Step-by-step UI setup guide with screenshots
- **When to use:**
  - For local testing, experimentation, and learning how agents can self-manage job evaluation.

- `buyer.ts` — Buyer agent logic and callbacks
- `seller.ts` — Seller agent logic and delivery
- `env.ts` — Environment configuration
- `README.md` — Full walkthrough and UI setup
- `images/` — UI screenshots and mockups

</details>

## 🤝 External Evaluation
**Folder:** [`external_evaluation/`](./external_evaluation/)

- **Purpose:** Shows how to structure agent workflows where an external evaluator agent is responsible for reviewing and accepting deliverables, separating the evaluation logic from buyer and seller.
- **Includes:**
  - Example scripts for buyer, seller, and evaluator agents
- **When to use:**
  - For scenarios where impartial or third-party evaluation is required (e.g., marketplaces, audits).

- `seller.ts` — Seller agent logic
- `evaluator.ts` — External evaluator agent logic
- `env.ts` — Environment configuration

## 💡 Helpers
**Folder:** [`helpers/`](../../helpers/)

- **Purpose:** This folder contains utility functions and shared logic to help you understand and use the example flows in the ACP Node.js SDK.
- **Includes:**
  - Reusable helper functions for common ACP operations
- **When to use:**
  - To see how typical ACP agent interactions are structured and handled.

## 📝 Prompt Tips: Use Natural Language
### Why Natural Language Matters
- Modern AI agents are trained primarily on **natural human language**, not raw code-like or database-style formats.
- Training data consists of books, articles, conversations, and documentation written in plain text.
- Prompts written in clear, conversational language produce:
    - More accurate responses
    - Better context awareness
    - User-friendly output

Reminder: Write prompts as if you are **explaining to another person**, not **feeding data into a database**.

### Examples
**Good:**
```json
We don’t support this ticker.  
Please choose another supported ticker from the platform.
```

**Bad:**
```json
{"errorCode":404,"inputName":"fake","supportedList":[],"message":"ticker unsupported"}
```
